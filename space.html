                                With the increasing number of entrepreneurs, the demand for office space is increasing.
                                Since many rising entrepreneurs can not afford to rent an independent office place hence
                                they have to rely on the co working places which allows multiple organizations to work
                                under a roof. There are several co working with excellent design and great facilities.
                                However all these highly decorated places are costly as well and many entrepreneurs
                                still are struggling to find a place within their budget. Hence we designed a co-working
                                place in a way that has all the necessary amenities for a perfect work environment
                                within the affordability of the rising entrepreneurs.
